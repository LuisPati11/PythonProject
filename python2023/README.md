### Hi, I'm Luis Pati√±o student of the Vilnius University. In this repository you can find my tasks about the subject Python Programming.

Task 1: I have created a basic interface that is asking the user what he wants to do with the CSV file. **Very important to indicate in the name of the file, the correct name. In this case salaries_clean.csv**

```sh

```
